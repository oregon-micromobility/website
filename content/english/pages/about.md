## What is Micromobility?
Micromobility refers to small human- and electric-powered vehicles like bikes, e-bikes, scooters, e-scooters, skateboards, and other personal mobility devices. These options have the potential to reduce costs, alleviate traffic congestion, improve public health, and reduce harmful GHG emissions pollution. 

## Oregon on the Move: Pioneering the Micromobility Revolution

Micromobility is being rapidly adopted by Oregonians, and shared systems are maturing in cities statewide. These devices enable users across rural, suburban, and urban areas to travel further and faster. They can extend the range of transit services and replace existing trips with added speed, affordability, and convenience. 

Many Oregonians will readily embrace micromobility for transportation with the right policies, programs, and infrastructure in place. Letâ€™s work together to reestablish Oregon as a national transportation innovation leader.
