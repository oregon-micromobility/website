### 2025 Legislation Priorities

The Oregon Micromobility Network (OMN) developed the framework below to help ensure that the 2025 Oregon Legislative session delivers on its promise by building broad consensus around policy which supports public and commercial interests. Our members represent local and state governments, shared system providers, academic institutions, nonprofits, transportation consultants, e-bike retailers and manufacturers, e-bike freight providers, advocacy organizations, and micromobility users. OMN is focused solely on these details and is one of the strongest groups of subject matter experts on the topic in North America.

### The Vision - Moving Forward for Sustained Success

#### Focus on Fiscal Responsibility
* **Underscore the value of micromobility;** investments will save households and taxpayers money as people drive less, reducing congestion, safety costs, and maintenance needs.

#### Support Rapid Adoption
* **Invest in shared micromobility systems,** such as bike- and scooter-share, pursuing transit integration and geographic expansion.
* **Promote device ownership** through equity-focused statewide incentive programs such as tax credits or rebates.

#### Educate System Users
* **Include micromobility** in driver education materials.
* **Reinvest in bicycle education courses,** incorporating micromobility skills and knowledge with a focus on youth safety and driver education, emphasizing proper helmet use, traffic laws, and responsible riding practices.
* **Communicate changes** to how micromobility can be used in Oregon.
* **Invest in battery safety outreach** to reduce the risk of charging fires.

#### Whole Systems Integration
* **Reframe “bicycle lanes” as “mobility lanes”** that accommodate users of all ages and abilities traveling on a variety of devices of different sizes and speeds. Standardize the provision of sufficient passing width and physical protection from motorist traffic.
* **Develop statewide guidance for speeds and use regulations** by location and infrastructure type, allowing flexibility for local regulations to supercede statewide ones.
* **Incorporate mode switch to micromobility in statewide planning and modeling efforts.** Consider the active Oregon Highway Plan update as an opportunity to operationalize the goals of the updated OTP through this framework.

## The Plan - Prioritize Safety & Clarify Regulations

#### Put Safety First

* **Today**: Children under 16 are not allowed to operate e-bikes ([HB4103](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2024R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB4103/Enrolled)) or e-scooters ([ORS 814.536](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_814.536)). This is out of line with many parents’ choices to let their children ride. Due to these age requirements, ODOT’s Safe Routes to School programs do not include micromobility.  
  * **Suggestion**: Remove age restrictions for the operation of low-speed (up to 20 mph) micromobility devices, and allow operation of all micromobility devices for 14- and 15-year-olds with learner’s permits.  
  * **Suggestion**: Require micromobility safety education with bicycle/pedestrian education in schools, as in [Minnesota](https://www.dot.state.mn.us/saferoutes/at-safety-education.html) and [Washington](https://wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/School-Based-Bicycle-Safety-Education-Program-Report-December2022.pdf).  
* **Today**: Regulations stipulate helmets are required on e-bikes for operators and riders younger than 16, and no helmets are required for those over 16 ([ORS 814.485](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_814.485)), but all e-scooter operators are required to wear a helmet, regardless of age ([ORS 814.534](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_814.534)).  
  * **Suggestion**: Ensure all low-speed (20 mph or less) micromobility devices have the same helmet requirement: required for those under 16, and encouraged if 16 or older.  
* **Today**: The e-bike definition ([HB4103](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2024R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB4103/Enrolled)) does not require a UL-certified battery; non-certified batteries pose fire safety risks and provide less value to customers.  
  * **Suggestion**: Add language that all new batteries sold in Oregon must be UL-certified or otherwise meet a federal safety standard, like in [California](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1271) and [NYC](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5839354&GUID=D0854615-5297-460B-BCBC-646D24A75B2E), and proposed in [Minnesota](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=SF5211&version=latest&session=ls93&session_year=2024&session_number=0).  
* **Today**: The Oregon Friendly Driver course is not required to receive a driver’s license.  
  * **Suggestion**: Require the completion of the course to receive a driver’s license, and/or incorporate materials from the course into driver education materials.  
  * **Suggestion**: Incentivize the completion of the course through an insurance discount for drivers and/or a diversion program. [ORS 742.490](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_742.490) requires insurance providers to offer a premium reduction for adults 55 and older who complete a safety course, and [ORS 811.508](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_811.508) allows persons who are cited for distracted driving to complete a course as a diversion from being convicted.

#### Clarify Device Definitions

* **Today**: There are [statutes defining some devices](https://www.oregon.gov/odot/forms/dmv/6619.pdf), but the lack of parity creates uncertainty, hampering micromobility’s integration into Oregon's transportation framework.  
  * **Suggestion**: Develop a blanket definition for *micromobility* that captures vehicle types not currently defined in statute, as well as new products yet to arrive. Examples include [SAE](https://www.sae.org/binaries/content/assets/cm/content/topics/micromobility/sae-j3194-summary---2019-11.pdf), [Minnesota](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/169.011), and [HB4067](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2024R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB4067/A-Engrossed). The definition should include non-powered vehicles like standard bicycles. Develop regulations for specific vehicles as needed.  
  * **Suggestion**: Ensure that any vehicle which—when purchased or modified—is capable of exceeding 28 mph with motor assistance is regulated as a motorcycle or another type of motor vehicle.  
  * **Suggestion**: Do not preclude commercial cargo use through wattage, wheel count, or weight restrictions; ensure that an exception is granted through a cargo classification.  
  * **Suggestion**: Ensure that disability mobility devices are not unduly restricted.  
  * **Suggestion**: Periodically review and revise these vehicle definitions to reflect the likely evolution of micromobility vehicles and their use.  
* **Today**: Speed limits for motor-assisted scooters are set at 15 mph ([ORS 814.512](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_814.512)), which is lower than the industry standard and out of parity with e-bikes ([HB4103](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2024R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB4103/Enrolled)).  
  * **Suggestion**: Increase the maximum speed for scooters to 20 mph, to match e-bikes.  
* **Today**: [HB4103](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2024R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB4103/Enrolled) will adopt the standard three-class e-bike definition on January 1st, 2025\.  
  * **Suggestion**: Amend the definition of class 1 and 3 e-bikes to allow for a “walk” or “startup” mode, as in [California](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1271).
