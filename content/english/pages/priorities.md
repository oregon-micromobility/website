#### Our Vision

* **Fiscal Responsibility**: Micromobility saves taxpayers and households money by reducing congestion and road maintenance.  
* **Rapid Adoption**: Expand shared systems, transit integration, and ownership incentives with equity-focused programs.  
* **Education & Safety**: Equip users with the knowledge to ride responsibly, including helmet use, traffic laws, and battery safety.  
* **System Integration**: Reframe “bike lanes” as “mobility lanes,” and establish uniform speed and usage regulations.

#### 2025 Legislative Priorities

* **Safety First**: Update outdated helmet, age, and device regulations to match user needs and safety standards.  
* **Device Definitions**: Create comprehensive definitions for micromobility vehicles to reduce regulatory confusion.  
* **Driver Education**: Integrate micromobility training into licensing and incentivize safe driving through insurance discounts.
